# lit-labs/router

`Lit Router` is the official router for [Lit](https://lit.dev/). It deeply integrates with **Lit** core to make building Single Page Applications with **Lit** a breeze.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @lit-labs/router
```

## Usage

Creating a single-page application with Lit + Lit Router is a piece of cake! üç∞ With Lit, we're building our application using components, and when we add Lit Router to the mix, all we have to do is assign our components to the routes and let Lit Router work its magic to render them in the right place. ‚ú® Here's a simple example for you: üöÄ

```js
// Import Lit Router
import '@lit-labs/router'

// Define your routes
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: 'home-page' },
  { path: '/about', component: 'about-page' },
  { path: '/users/:id', component: 'user-page' },
]

// Get a router
const $router = document.querySelector('lit-router')

// Register your routes
$router.setRoutes(routes)
```

## Programmatic Navigation

Lit Router also provides a simple API for programmatic navigation. You can use the `navigate` method to navigate to a specific route. Here's an example:

```ts
// import { navigate } from '@lit-labs/router'

// Navigate by path
$router.navigate({ path: '/about' })

// Navigate by name
$router.navigate({ name: 'about' })
```

### Navigate for history

You can also use the `forward` & `back` method to navigate for history. Here's an example:

```ts
// import { forward, back } from '@lit-labs/router'

// Navigate forward
$router.forward()

// Navigate back
$router.back()
```
